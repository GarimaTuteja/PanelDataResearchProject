<h2> Problem To be Solved </h2>

Do shall-issues law reduce crime-or not?

<h2> What is Shall Issue </h2>

The impact of guns on crime in America has triggered a lot of public debate. Many strongly believe that state laws enabling citizens to carry concealed handguns had reduced crime. According to this view, gun control laws take away guns from law-abiding citizens, while would-be criminals ignore those leaving potential victims defenceless. Following this view,The National Rifle Association (NRA) and many politicians across the country advance the cause of greater freedom to carry guns.
As a result, many states in the United States have passed right-to-carry laws (also known as a shall-issue laws).<b> A Shall-issue law is one that requires that governments issue concealed carry handgun permits to any applicant who meets the necessary criteria. These criteria are the applicant must be an adult, have no significant criminal record, and no history of mental illness and successfully complete a course in firearms safety training (if required by law). If
these criteria are met, the granting authority has no discretion in the awarding of the licenses, and there is no requirement of the applicant to demonstrate "good cause".</b>
